# course-booking-app

This app provides a simple course viewing and selection service for students and instructors. Users are able to create accounts as students or instructors and log into the app. There is also a preloaded administrator account. 

Students can search for a course by course code, course name, and course days. Instructors can also perform searches but cannot search by days. Both types of users can enable the filter “my courses,” which displays only courses they are enrolled in or instructing.

If a student clicks on a course, there is the option to enroll or unenroll from that course. If an instructor does so, there is the option to instruct or stop instructing that course. Selecting a course brings up a menu with the course details (such as course name, course code, description, capacity, days, and times).

If the user is the course’s instructor, they can also modify the details. If they do not instruct the course, they can still view the course details, but cannot change any fields.

The administrator can manage user accounts, and also create and delete courses. 

All input fields are appropriately validated, and there exist error messages for incorrect formatting.
