# course-booking-app
Android application coded from scratch in Android Studio by @achawathe, @EricVan14, @michaeltsoon, and @jordanxlau. (Contributors are listed alphabetically.)

This app implements a basic course selection service for students and instructors. Students are able to search for a course; instructors are able to edit details about courses; and administrators are able to manage users and courses.

Project developed for SEG 2105 at the University of Ottawa.
