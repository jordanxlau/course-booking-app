# course-booking-app
Android application coded from scratch in Android Studio by @jordanxlau, @achawathe, @EricVan14, @noobstang and @michaeltsoon.

This app implements a basic course selection service for students and instructors. Students are able to search for a course; instructors are able to edit details about courses; and administrators are able to manage users and courses.

Project developed for SEG 2105, University of Ottawa.
